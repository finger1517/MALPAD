Chinses stock market surge, banking sector shows confidence;  
my position includes CSI 300, Shanghai Composite Index, and also HSI and HSTI, all of them rised up;

# Thinking 
1. after claude-3.7-sonnet, I think we should have some Industrial functional Evaluation Benchmark in our work;  
why it is that good,  
why MANUS and other agent apps like to use claude, 
and new metric should be defined accurately;  


3. maybe the platform for Evaluation is not good enough, at first, we should propose Evaluation as Infra to serve all people; the concept of "one - serve - all" has its merits, but it also has some drawbacks. When the demands are excessive, the core personnel can't manage them, and as a result, the Evaluation Infra Group will become bloated and inefficient. (like technology middle platform in Alibaba)
