I am starting to write the anthropic computer use support for OSWorld;  
I need to build an Agent that realize the prediction;
the problem is, if I use model based prediction and llm-call;  
it will whatever finish the job;  
but, when I use API, and it has it's own standard and it's not easy to findout;  
it will be easy to fail at API level;
