# Tech
1. learn ray conceptions:
- ray.serve: deploy model as a service, it can be used to build a web service, making multiple instances of the same model running in parallel, I use it to enlarge the concurrency of the embedding model
- ray.air: build, train, and tune models
- ray.core: manage core components like task, actor, and object store

# Investment
1. Tech is too hot, I should not reinvest in Hengseng Tech, I won't invest more on it

# Thinking
It feels like I have not enough reflection on my life, I should write more to reflect and conclude more;;

cause I think I have a good aesthetic, but I don't have a good way to express it. So if I need to grow better, I need expose myself into my judgement and thinking.
