# Thinking 
Although the spring is coming, we still feel the wind and cold.

- you're so naive, things won't change as I don't like them.
- the unfair won't stop when you don't like them.
- you think that angry can change your life?
- you think that your unstatisfication will change the situaion about the comany?
- if you want to complain, just blame that you are coming to the wrong place, to the place that company is failing, that everyone is so hypocritical, pedantica and snobbish.
- you should complain that you have too much wondering, you are so navie to think that if you don't like, you can change the people all around.
- you think you can change the era by yourself?
