# Sport
I went to the National Swimming Center and swam continuously for 1000m.

# Thinking
Although spring is coming, we still feel the wind and cold.

- You're so naive, things won't change just because you don't like them.
- The unfairness won't stop just because you don't like it.
- Do you think anger can make any difference to change your life?
- Do you think your dissatisfaction will change the situation in the company?
- If you want to complain, just blame yourself for coming to the wrong place - a failing company where everyone is hypocritical, pedantic and snobbish.
- You should blame yourself for having too many illusions, being so naive to think that you can change everyone around you just because you don't like them.
- Do you think you can change an era by yourself?
