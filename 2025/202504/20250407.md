## ray design of the video provessing framework
the architecture of t2v_data,
Zhiming wrote
there are several design of the old architecture:
1. there are several part:
- splitting: input video -> split into clips
- filtering: using CPU-based and GPU-based models to filter clips
- calculating: using CPU-based models and GPU-based models to calculate the clips
- captioning: use VLMs to do the captioning for each clip

I think all of them should be output as a state dictionary,
we collect the dict, and put them all together




drawback of the old architecture:
1. use MPI to do the communication
2. do not support heterogeneous resource management
3. hard to init, and scaling






## google code reivew practice
what should be care about as a code reviewer
1. design 
2. functionality
3. complexity
4. testing
5. naming
6. comments
7. documentation
8. style



## learning about agentic design -- what should we do when we design a product in the age of AI
1. what is the agentic design
- like cursor, we should design features that use AI agents when we talk about the product design
