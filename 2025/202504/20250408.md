# Life
I should get a better sleep and then I can get up at 8:30, then there is 90 minutes left to me. This time can be used productively for morning routines, exercise, or personal development. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule is crucial for maintaining energy levels throughout the day. By waking up at 8:30, I'll have ample time to prepare for the day ahead while ensuring I get sufficient rest. This balanced approach will help me maintain both physical and mental well-being, setting a positive tone for the rest of the day.


# Tech 
## zhiming share

1. splitting the raw data
- detect timestamp
- split video using ffmpeg
2. filtering
- corase filter
- mlp filtering
3. calculating
- motion score(cpu)
- aesthetic score(gpu)
- phash(cpu)
- ...
4. 




black borader detection:


binary classifier:
- clip4clip
- internvideo2
- video llama 
all those to do the video embedding



### speed up
classification_speedup, how to detect if the video is speed up?:
C3D:  
learning spatio-temporal features

数据集构造：
- 手动加速视频
grounding DINO detection " human, animal, creature", area should be larger than 1/3

get 388 bad video, add the annotation data;  
good video is 4419





WDS data;
web-dataset-package;
or
you can just uncompress the data into dirs.












motion score; 色块， 二范数只和
reversed_SSIM， 越不相似；越高
亮度；对比度；观感

phash, use dct to transform the image into frequency domain, and then use hamming distance to calculate the similarity;


bluescore_LV: ??
AES: aesthetic score
OFS: optical flow score
DOVER: 用户生成式的评价没学， tencent hunyuan
