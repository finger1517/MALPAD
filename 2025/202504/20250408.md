I should get a better sleep and then I can get up at 8:30, then there is 90 minutes left to me. This time can be used productively for morning routines, exercise, or personal development. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule is crucial for maintaining energy levels throughout the day. By waking up at 8:30, I'll have ample time to prepare for the day ahead while ensuring I get sufficient rest. This balanced approach will help me maintain both physical and mental well-being, setting a positive tone for the rest of the day.
