## ray patterns and anti patterns

1. patterns:
- using nested tasks to achieve nested parallelism
- using generators to reduce heap memory usage
- using ray.wait to limit the number of pending tasks
- using resources to limit the number of concurrently running tasks
- using asyncio to run actor methods concurrently
- using an actor sychronize other tasks and actors
- using pipelining to increase throughput

2. anti patterns:
- returning ray.put() ObjectRefs from a task harms performance and falult tolerance
- calling ray.get in a loop harms parallelism
- calling ray.get unnecessarily harms performance
- processing results in submission order using ray.get increases runtime
- fetching too many objects at once with ray.get causes failure
- over parallellizing with too fine-grained tasks harms speedup
- redifining the same remote function or class or class harms performance
- passing the same large argument by value repeatedly harms performance
- closure capturing large objects harms performance
- using global variables to share state between tasks and actors
- serialize ray.ObjectRef out of band
- forking new processes in application code

## CPU and GPU control on an actor

we can use `cpu_only_node` to mark the cpu only node, when we want some ray actor to run on the cpu only node, we just specify the resource, like actor.options(resources={"cpu_only_node": 1}).remote()
```shell
# 在只有 CPU 的节点上启动 ray worker
ray start --address='<head_node_ip>:6379' --resources='{"cpu_only_node": 1}'
```

```python
@ray.remote(num_cpus=1) # 这个 Actor 只需要 CPU
class CpuOnlyActor:
    def __init__(self):
        print(f"CPU Only Actor running on node: {ray.runtime_context.get_runtime_context().get_node_id()}")
    def process(self, data):
        # ... CPU密集型任务 ...
        return data * 2

targeted_actor = CpuOnlyActor.options(
    num_cpus=1,
    resources={"cpu_only_node": 1} # 请求这个自定义资源
).remote()
```
