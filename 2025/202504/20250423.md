# time consuming
I would rather to split my work into 4 2-hours:
1. slot1: 10:00 - 12:00
2. slot2: 14:00 - 16:00
3. slot3: 16:30 - 18:30
4. slot4: 19:30 - 21:30

I find it really takes time to do something, and time flies. I need to do some core things to make those time valuable. So I decide to record 4 slots for my work everyday.
