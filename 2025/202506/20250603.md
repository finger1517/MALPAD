Better things happens with better people.


- it is not worth it to read new papers, as an engineer, but for scientists, it is necessary, even though most of them use so much tricks to make their papers look better.

# Tech
- CNN(3D CNN, ResNet) is efficient feature extractor, and Transformer is a powerful feature fusion module.
- Time Fusion


- build knowledge graph for indexing knowledge;
- Ragent
    - ray data;
    - database: character and semantic search;
    - document process will use ray data offline processing;
    - agent protocol to realize the service;
    - agent itself is not heavy, but the tool or LLM would be heavy, it is more like a io-bounded program, and is easy to scale horizontally, so there is no need to use ray to scale the agent-framework;

- LangGraph
    - 3 core elements:
        - state: share the core info, all nodes can access and change;
        - node: functional unit, input is the state and return the update;
        - edge: define the relationship among nodes;
