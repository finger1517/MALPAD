# NOT-Always-end-to-end
we should climb the stairs step by step, 
some models should be computational efficient,
some models should be powerful.

# Industrial application is a system design
 - different models with different algorithms
 



Multi-model understanding and Agent:  
basic modules


frontier,
high frequency,
encouraged to explore


# Architecture
- agentic RAG
- elements
    - sensing
    - planning
    - decision making
    - action(tool/API using)

# Retrival
- embedding



# Agent Categorzing
- Big Agent
    - planner, scheduler, context cutting and storing, and checking;
- Small Agent
    - worker, tooling caller; using MCP, the traditional software can be a MCP server, and AI era software, it can also be seen as an agent, can also be a MCP server?
- Google A2A
    - in so many agents, how does it know other agents?

1. MANUS - less structure, more intelligence

2. filter the image, let it be pretty





 - an efficient retrival system;
